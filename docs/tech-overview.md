### MongoDB

### Mongoose

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation.

### LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a library for building language-powered applications using LLMs (Large Language Models). It provides tools to integrate these models into applications, allowing the use of advanced natural language processing capabilities to enhance app functionalities.

### Papa Parse

[Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) a  JavaScript library for parsing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. It is capable of handling large files and performs operations efficiently in-browser. One of the key reasons for use of Papa Parse is its ability to handle files as buffers. This approach allows to send unprocessed, raw data directly to the server where heavy processing can be performed more effectively. This method is preferable in scenarios where client-side resources are limited, and offloading processing to the server can significantly enhance performance and scalability.

### Nano ID

[Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) helps us generate unique, secure, and URL-friendly string IDs. It's incredibly lightweight and efficient, perfect for creating identifiers that are safe to use in URLs without exposing sensitive database details.
